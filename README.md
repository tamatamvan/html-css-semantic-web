# Semantic HTML and css
This is an example of using semanctic HTML and CSS, in this repo I just made a clone of my previous website project homepage, that is [susansfood.com](http://susansfood.com). Originally, the website built with Laravel, so I've to convert from blade templating to single static HTML page.

Here, I use a lot of library such as, Bootstrap, JQuery, google fonts, animate.css, wow.js, owl-carousel, modenizr, and some other libraries.

For the resources, I just serve almost all libraries and images, except the images that the link generated from the database, I just copied the link and place them to `src` attributes of the `<img>` tags.
